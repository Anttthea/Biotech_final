What cause abnormal neuronal migration?
What does Impaired neuronal migration affect ?
What does we identify?
What does the S140G mutation decrease?
What reduces GTP Binding?

Q1: Easy, direct match
Answer: Mutations in α-Tubulin

Q2: affect vs affects
Answer: behavior as well as brain structure

Q3: Tricky question, because in the document this phase appears frequently, just use this question for evaluation, no golden answer

Q4: too complicated...
Answer: the ability of CCT bound quasi-native α-tubulin folding intermediates to incorporate GTP by approximately 5-fold.
Answer: the ability of CCT

Q5: Easy
Answer: S140G Mutation


What controls apoptosis?
What does Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins on mitochondria inhibit?
What does Bcl-xL interact?
What controls the permeabilization of mitochondria?
What does antiapoptotic proteins bind?

Q1. Easy for type 1, direct answer in the title
Answer: Traveling Bax and Forth from Mitochondria

Q2. Easy for type 2, direct answer in the abstract
Answer: prodeath proteins

Q3. Tricky question, because is ambiguously provided in the document
Answer 1: Not provided
Answer 2: on the mitochondrial surface
Answer 2 is to some extent acceptable

Q4. A little bit difficult, passage voice
Answer: proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family

Q5. Difficult, a lot of noise.
Answer: Bax and Bak
