The prevalence of invasive candidiasis in burn cases varies widely, but it accounts for 3&#x02013;23% of severe infection with a mortality rate ranging from 14 to 70%. Therefore, it is imperative that we develop innovative therapeutics to which this fungus is unlikely to evolve resistance, thus curtailing the associated morbidity and mortality and ultimately improving our capacity to treat these infections. An inexpensive and stable nitric oxide (NO)-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) platform has been recently developed. NO is known to have direct antifungal activity, modulate host immune responses and significantly regulate wound healing. In this study, we hypothesized that NO-np would be an effective therapy in the treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> burn infections. Using a murine burn model, NO-np demonstrated antifungal activity against <italic>C. albicans in vivo</italic>, most likely by arresting its growth and morphogenesis as demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>. NO-np demonstrated effective antimicrobial activity against yeast and filamentous forms of the fungus. Moreover, we showed that NO-np significantly accelerated the rate of wound healing in cutaneous burn infections when compared to controls. The histological evaluation of the affected tissue revealed that NO-np treatment modified leukocyte infiltration, minimized the fungal burden, and reduced collagen degradation, thus providing potential mechanisms for the therapeutics&#x02019; biological activity. Together, these data suggest that NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel topical antifungal which can be used for the treatment of cutaneous burn infections and wounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitric oxide</kwd><kwd>nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>burn healing</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="6604"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death after a severe burn injury. The rate of microbial infection is estimated to range from 30 to 63% among all burn victims admitted to burn centers, with the incidence also associated with the severity of injury and the duration of hospital stay (Holzheimer and Dralle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>). Microorganisms responsible for sepsis are usually bacteria, including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>; however, <italic>Candida</italic> spp., of which <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the most common, are etiologic in &#x0223c;8% of all cases (Santucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2003</xref>). Burn wound colonization and local infection with <italic>Candida</italic> spp., can progress to systemic disease. The prevalence of invasive candidiasis in burn cases accounts for as much as &#x0223c;23% of severe infections (Holzheimer and Dralle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>) with mortality rates ranging from 14 to 70% (Holzheimer and Dralle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>; Eggimann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2003a</xref>).</p><p>We recently developed and characterized an inexpensive and stable nitric oxide (NO)-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) platform using nanotechnology based on a silane hydrogel (Eggimann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2003b</xref>). This technology has the potential to serve as a novel, easily applied, topical delivery system for antimicrobials, such as NO, which can be used for the treatment of complex cutaneous infections and wounds. In both physiologic and pathologic conditions, NO maintains skin homeostasis by regulating circulation, ultraviolet-mediated melanogenesis, and sunburn erythema, which all participate in the maintenance of the skin as a protective barrier against microorganisms (Frank et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2002</xref>). Notably, NO also modulates immune responses and is a significant regulator of wound healing (Soneja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2005</xref>; Mowbray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2008</xref>). In fact, the simplicity and the stability of NO-np for use in sustained delivery of NO make the nanoparticles a very attractive treatment modality for many conditions. This is supported by our previous work which demonstrated potent NO-np efficacy <italic>in vitro</italic> (Friedman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2011</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> against multi-drug resistant bacteria which currently challenge many of the successful antibiotic therapies (Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2009</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2009</xref>; Mihu et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2010</xref>; Schairer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2012</xref>). Ghaffari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>) has shown that NO is effective against <italic>C. albicans</italic> even though the fungus possesses a highly inducible NO defense mechanism (Ullmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2004</xref>; Tillmann et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2011</xref>). Based on our previous work and the fact that NO easily transits most if not all biological barriers, we have hypothesized that NO-np would be fungicidal for <italic>C. albicans</italic> in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting. Hence, NO-np could be an effective means for treating burned infections caused by this fungus. To validate this hypothesis, we have investigated the biological impact of NO-np on <italic>C. albicans</italic> using a murine burn infection model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Candida albicans</title><p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> SC5314 was obtained from M. Ghannoum (Cleveland, OH, USA). Unless otherwise stated, the isolate was grown in yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose (YPD) broth (Difco Laboratories) containing 10&#x02009;g/L yeast extract, 10&#x02009;g/L peptone, and 20&#x02009;g/L glucose and incubated for 24&#x02009;h at 30&#x000b0;C in a shaker set at 150&#x02009;rpm (IKA KS 4000, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA; to early stationary phase).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of NO-np</title><p>A hydrogel/glass composite was synthesized using a mixture of tetramethyl orthosilicate, polyethylene glycol, chitosan, glucose, and sodium nitrite in a 0.5&#x02009;m<sc>m</sc> sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). The nitrite was reduced to NO within the matrix with thermally generated electrons from glucose. After the redox reaction, the ingredients were combined and dried using a lyophilizer, and which resulted in a fine powder comprised of nanoparticles containing NO. The NO-np remains stable in this form for more than 1&#x02009;year at room temperature. Once exposed to an aqueous environment, the hydrogel properties of the composite allow for an opening of the water channels inside the particles, facilitating the release of the trapped NO overextended time periods. Nanoparticles (np) were also prepared without the addition of NO, and served as a control.</p></sec><sec><title>Susceptibility of <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 to NO-np</title><p>To determine the impact of the NO-np on <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 1&#x02009;mL of YPD broth was inoculated with a 24&#x02009;h colony of the fungus grown on YPD agar.

The inoculated plate was then incubated for 24&#x02009;h at 37&#x000b0;C. Controls included wells containing yeast suspension alone, and yeast cells in YPD broth containing np.

Five-mm diameter burn injuries were created applying a 60&#x02009;s-heated brass bar for 45&#x02009;s. Immediately after injury, <italic>C. albicans</italic> was inoculated onto the burned tissue using a 10<sup>7</sup> cell suspension of the yeast prepared in PBS. Animals were individually housed to prevent crossed infection. On day 1 after infection, 5&#x02009;mg of NO-np or np powder was then applied. Applications were similarly performed on days 3 and 5 after injury. Untreated, injured mice were used as additional controls. To monitor healing, photographs were taken daily. Also, a caliper was used to blindly measure the burn diameter of the injury on a daily basis, and was performed by two independent investigators. Three and 7&#x02009;days after infection, mice were euthanized and tissue biopsies were taken.</p></sec><sec><title>CFU determinations</title><p>At days 3 and 7 after <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, wound tissues were excised and homogenized in sterile PBS.

Briefly, 10<sup>6</sup> yeasts were plated on a polylysine coated coverslip bottom of MatTek plates. Images were collected for 2&#x02009;h at 40&#x000d7; using a Zeiss Axiovert 200&#x02009;M inverted microscope with an Axiocam MR camera controlled by the Axio Vision 4.4 software (Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging, NY). This microscope was housed in a Plexiglas box and the temperature was stabilized at 37&#x000b0;C, using a forced air heater system. The plate lid was kept in place to prevent evaporation, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> was delivered to a chamber locally over the culture dish.

Metabolic activity was measured by 2, 3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium-hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay.</p></sec><sec><title>XTT reduction assay</title><p>For filamentous <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314, 50&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of XTT salt solution (1&#x02009;mg/mL in PBS) and 4&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of menadione solution (1&#x02009;mM in acetone; Sigma) were added to each well. Microtiter plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;h. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases in live cells reduce XTT tetrazolium salt to XTT formazan, resulting in a colorimetric change, which was measured in a microtiter reader at 492&#x02009;nm. Microtiter wells containing heat-killed fungi or only medium but no filamentous <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells were used as negative controls.

Notably, <italic>C. albicans</italic> grown with np had significant reductions in fungal growth at 4&#x02009;h, an effect that is likely due to steric interference with cell to cell contact or communication (e.g., quorum sensing). It is also possible that the chitosan incorporated into the np may offer some degree of antifungal activity; although the concentrations used to generate the np were negligible. When nano-scaled, chitosan has a higher surface to volume ratio, translating into a higher surface charge density, and increased affinity for bacteria and fungi with greater antimicrobial activity (Qi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2004</xref>). Therefore at the nano-scale, the concentration used may confer some inhibitory activity. Nevertheless, NO-np significantly impeded growth relative to the np controls at &#x0003e;4&#x02009;h (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The effect of NO-np on <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth kinetics was determined using Bioscreen C analysis</bold>. <italic>C. albicans</italic> was grown in the absence (untreated) or presence of nanoparticles with NO (NO-np) or without NO (np).

<italic>albicans</italic> has emerged as a major agent of hospital-acquired infections and this fungus has a high incidence of progression from focal infection to invasive and/or systemic diseases in specific patient subpopulations such as burn victims (Holzheimer and Dralle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2002</xref>). Our data shows that NO-np interferes with <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is likely attributable to the sustained release of NO that can penetrate and permeabilize the cellular membrane of yeast cells. The rate and amount of NO released from this nanotechnology allows the free radical to alter peripheral and integral structures on the yeast membrane, particularly membrane-bound proteins and lipids. As a lipophilic and uncharged molecule, NO can easily transverse the lipid bilayer to reach key metabolic enzymes, messenger RNA, proteins, and DNA, disabling vital biological processes (Jones et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). Furthermore, formation of peroxynitrite from interactions with superoxides further disrupts the yeast membrane through lipid peroxidation, accelerating degradation of cellular integrity. Previous studies suggest that NO greatly accelerates the rate at which hydrogen peroxide kills microbes by damaging their DNA (Woodmansee and Imlay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2003</xref>). NO also blocks respiration, an event that can stimulate oxidative DNA damage (Woodmansee and Imlay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2003</xref>). Likewise, alterations in cell charge may lead to increased phagocytosis and killing of fungal cells by phagocytes (Nosanchuk and Casadevall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1997</xref>). Recently, we suggested that NO-np is a promising candidate for use in cutaneous infections due to its excellent tissue penetration and potent, broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Witte et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1998</xref>; Ghaffari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>; Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2009</xref>). In this regard, NO is able to diffuse through skin and soft tissues thereby reducing the microbial burden.</p><p>Our studies demonstrate that NO-np have significant antifungal efficacy in the setting of <italic>C. albicans-</italic>infected burn injury. Burn injuries and infection can lead to serious complications including tissue damage, sepsis and death. NO-np was found to prevent fungal invasion to the subcutis/muscle and reduced dermal candidal burden. NO also stimulated the infiltration of innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (Ghaffari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2007</xref>), which enhanced its impact as an antifungal agent. NO-np can potentially induce a protective immune response capable of containing infection, therefore preventing systemic dissemination. Additionally, time-lapse microscopy images suggest that NO-np may arrest growth and morphogenesis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> during infection. The mechanisms underlying these effects of the NO-np on morphogenesis are not yet elucidated, and are likely multi-factorial, potentially impacting adhesion (Privett et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2010</xref>), colonization (Elahi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2001</xref>), tissue penetration (Ghaffari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2006</xref>), and dissemination (Glittenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2011</xref>). The effects of the particles can be as simple as interfering with cell-cell interactions (Netea et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>; Glittenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2011</xref>) or quorum sensing to disrupting cell signaling cascades (Toenjes et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">2009</xref>) or directly damaging DNA (Woodmansee and Imlay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">2003</xref>; Jones et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). Perhaps, NO-np may directly influence cyclic AMP&#x02013;protein kinase A complex which is the major pathway by which hyphal growth is regulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (Bahn et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2007</xref>). This is a promising area for future studies.</p><p>NO-np treatment of <italic>C. albicans</italic> burn injuries offers additional benefits, as we found that treatment results in the stimulation of healing by induction of collagen deposition and/or protects against collagen degradation. NO promotes wound healing by inducing collagen secretion by fibroblasts (Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2012</xref>). Acceleration of wound healing by nitric oxide donors (Lund and Scholefield, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1997</xref>) and NO-np has also been demonstrated recently (Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2009</xref>; Han et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2012</xref>). Indeed, accelerated healing of gastric ulcers has been demonstrated in rats treated with a nitric oxide releasing derivative of diclofenac, and a similar effect was observed by treating the rats with glyceryl trinitrate (Elliott et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">1995</xref>). Further, Thornton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">1998</xref>) demonstrated that collagen deposition can be enhanced in wounded rats transfected <italic>in vivo</italic> with the gene for inducible nitric oxide synthase, and the increased nitric production within the wound milieu preceded the observed increase in collagen synthesis. Additionally, we recently suggested that topically applied NO-np might also prevent collagen degradation by microbial collagenases through a reduction in microbial load (Martinez et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2009</xref>). Pathogens can impair the repair processes by producing toxic byproducts and competing with cells for oxygen and nutrients (Robson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1990</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> adheres to laminin and fibronectin, types I and IV collagen proteins (Alonso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2001</xref>) and releases metalloproteases that degrade collagen (Imbert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2002</xref>) which facilitate the migration of the yeast in tissues after crossing the endothelial layer, allowing for fungal invasion of target organs (Rodier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">1999</xref>). Impeding the metabolic function of microbes diminishes their capacity to damage host tissues.</p><p>Concomitant to reducing host damage by injuring invading microbes, NO modifies the host effector response. In addition to their antimicrobial functions, neutrophils are recruited from the blood to sites of inflammation, where they contribute to wound healing (Theilgaard-Monch et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2004</xref>). Once in the wound environment, neutrophils phagocytose foreign material and bacteria, destroying them by releasing proteolytic enzymes and oxygen-derived free radical species. Nevertheless, in the absence of ongoing infection, neutrophil activity gradually changes within a few days of injury to prevent tissue damage. In later stages of healing, the neutrophils must be eliminated from the wound site. Redundant cells are disposed of by extrusion to the wound surface as either slough or by apoptosis, allowing elimination of the entire neutrophil population without further tissue damage or potentiation of the inflammatory response. The cell remnants and apoptotic bodies are then phagocytosed by macrophages. Consistent with this finding we found relatively high numbers of neutrophils in wounds of NO-np-treated mice early on in the infection.</p><p>The role of macrophages in wound healing has evolved from the concept that macrophages primarily clear a wound of foreign material, to the understanding that macrophages are involved in multiple aspects ranging from re-epithelialization and collagen deposition to angiogenesis and cell proliferation (Mirza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2009</xref>; Friedman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2011</xref>). We use Iba-1, an actin-cross-linking protein expressed in macrophage-like cells but not restricted to the macrophage lineage to investigate the effect of NO on macrophage-like infiltration in the wound environment. While many studies have focused on the role of macrophage-like cells inducing NO release from iNOS as part of the host defense, our data suggests that NO also modulates macrophage-like cell activity, similar to the manner in which NO and VEGF exhibit reciprocal regulation (Kimura and Esumi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2003</xref>; Broughton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2006</xref>). We further observed in our study that macrophage migration is increased in NO-np-treated mice suggesting that NO is a wide-acting, critical molecule in the early and late stages of tissue repair and regeneration.</p><p>Safety and toxicity of nanotechnology have been well documented and widely discussed (Service, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2003</xref>; Nel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2006</xref>). Numerous investigations have revealed that diverse nanomaterials can penetrate intact skin in animal models and in human <italic>ex vivo</italic> models (Gamer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2006</xref>; Baroli et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2007</xref>). Furthermore, cutaneous penetration of NO-np can be enhanced depending on the delivery vehicle used or barrier disruption found, especially this is true in cases of open wounds, such as those that we describe in this study. Of greater concern are toxicities caused by the systemic penetration and ultimate circulation of specific nanomaterials through various orifices, and which have been shown to occur (Hohr et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2002</xref>). We have demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> that NO-nps show minimal toxicity toward cultured fibroblasts (Friedman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>in vivo</italic> safety (murine) evaluations using intraperitoneal and intravenous administration routes minimal cytotoxicity was found with no clinical adverse events occurring in the treated mice (Cabrales et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2011</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this study shows that NO-np have both antifungal and burn healing properties. Overall, the results presented show that the topical application of NO-np is highly effective against cutaneous <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection in a murine burn model. In addition, the NO-np appears to enhance burn healing by shielding dermal structural components, such as collagen from degradation, and likely stimulates new collagen generation and deposition. These findings support other studies, which have shown that topically applied NO-np can be effective in inducing a local immune response with minimal inflammation (Mowbray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2009</xref>), further adding to its beneficial effects in this application. These results suggest that this platform has the potential to serve as an easily administered source of anti-infectives, such as NO, for the treatment of cutaneous and tissue infections, including those resulting from burn injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>Adam J.
